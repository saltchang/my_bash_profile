# Workspaces folder

This folder is for saving the vscode workspace file for your projects.

Run `./install-workspace.sh` in the root directory of `terminal-setup/` to create a symbolic link from `$HOME/projects/workspaces` to the `terminal-setup/workspaces` folder.

You can store the vscode workspace file (`*.code-workspace`) in `workspaces/` to reuse it in any device you want.
